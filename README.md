# Signature Verification and Forgery Recognition System Using KNN, Backpropagation and CNN
Design a smart system that can accurately verify the characters unique to the original signature with the high accuracy.
 Also extract the signature from a document. The core of the project lies in the creation of a signature verification system.
 This system will employ advanced machine learning and computer vision techniques to meticulously analyze the unique
 traits within the extracted signature. These traits may include stroke patterns, pressure points, pen angle, and other
 distinctive features that differentiate one person’s authentic signature from a forgery. Achieving a high level of accuracy in
 this verification process is imperative to ensure the system’s reliability.
